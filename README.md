# Exceedra tech test

## Description

Create a process which solves parts A and B below; and then answer part C. Document your work using either a flowchart, pseudo-code, a written sequence of steps, or a programming language you are familiar with. The table below is example data, but your solution should be generic and hence applicable to any data supplied in this format.

  A.	Identify which pairs of rows have identical Products, Customers and Measures, and overlapping date ranges; e.g., as per rows 1 and 2.

  B.	Of the rows identified in part A, update the rows to make the date ranges not overlap.

  C.	Document any assumptions or decisions you needed to make for your solution.
